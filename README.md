# Project-02

### The Book Nook
---
The Book Nook is a book discussion app which requires a user login to contribute to the discussion. Any visitor is able to use the app as a regular book search. A registration is available for anyone who wants to join discussions.

###### The Home Page
Displays all the books which are being currently discussed by users.

###### Browse Books
Displays the popular books on entering the page and includes a book search which talks to the Google Books API

###### Login/Register
Lets users login or register

###### Books Details
On click of a book takes you to the book details page which displayes the title, author and a synopsis of the book.

It also includes any comments below if a discussion is available and you are already logged in. If not, a link is available to login and redirects you back to the discussion.

The requirements of the project were to;

- Have at least 2 models.
- Include Sign up/Login functionalities
- Have complete RESTful routes
- Utilize SQL or ORM to create a database table structure

I came up with the idea of having a book discussion page mainly because of my love for reading. Plus since it was possible to use a books API instead of manually adding book details into my database.
I drew the table structure and came up with a basic design for the app and built up on it.
